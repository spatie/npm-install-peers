# NPM Install Peers

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.md)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/npm-install-peers.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-install-peers)

CLI command to install npm peerDependencies. This can be useful when developing modules.

Consider the following dependencies:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "react-router": "4.2.0"
    },
    "devDependencies": {},
    "peerDependencies": {
        "moment": "2.21.0"
    },
}
```

If you run this `npm-install-peers` command, `moment` will be installed because it's a **direct** peer dependency of your project. You'll still get a warning that `react-router` is missing a `react` peer dependency. You'll still need to install `react` yourself, this command **only installs direct peer dependencies**.

You probably don't need this package! It's generally a better idea to have your `peerDependencies` contents as `devDependencies` too.
